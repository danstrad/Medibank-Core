			<Text type="Content">Australian adults are spending more time in front of screens than sleeping, according to a new community survey commissioned by Medibank.
Medibank Health Check – Is it time to unplug? is the first in a series of community surveys which will examine Australians’ views on emerging health issues.
For this study, 1,505 Australians were asked about their views on screen usage and its impact on health.
A clear conclusion has been found: people suspect there is something concerning about the amount of time they spend in front of screens, but they are uncertain about exactly what the health impact is.
[b]Snapshot of screen use[/b]
The key findings of the study include:
• People spend a lot of time on screens. Respondents estimated they spend an average of six hours a day in front of screens for leisure, and a further three hours for work or study. When combined, this is more than the recommended eight hours for sleep.
• Most of this time is in front of computers. About 40% of this time is in front of computers, with TV taking the next biggest time share at 31%.
• There is uncertainty about health risks. While 62% of respondents know that reduced physical activity is a consequence of too much screen time, almost half of those surveyed failed to recognise the likelihood of other health risks, which include obesity, attention difficulty, low self-esteem and depression.

[b]What influences screen use?[/b]
• Age influences which screens you’re using. In general terms, the older you are the less time you are likely to spend in front of TVs and smartphones. The opposite is generally true for computers – the older you are, the more time you are likely to spend in front of computers.
• Screen time is consistent across Australia. The study found little difference in screen use across states and only minor difference between rural versus metro locations.
• Higher income links to more screens, but not necessarily more screen time. Households with higher income are more likely to have a larger number of screens available within the home. However, the amount of time spent in front of screens does not vary significantly by income.
[b]What does this mean?[/b]
Medibank spokesman Dr Ian Boyd said some of the key results in the Medibank Health Check survey were concerning.
“It is worrying that adults are spending more time in front of screens than sleeping, and while they want to change their behaviour they don’t seem to know what to do about it,” he said.
“More than 60% of respondents with children agreed that screen time affects their family time, and their family’s health, and 57% of these want to cut back on screen time.
“And one in five say that if they weren’t in front of a screen they would be involved in a physical activity instead such as going for a run, riding a bike or going for a walk.”
Dr Boyd said that enough concern had been raised about screen-time to warrant further research and education to improve community health outcomes.
“There needs to be much greater community education is needed around what are safe levels of screen time and more programs are needed to encourage people to unplug and get involved in other recreational activities,” he said.
“The benefits of unplugging and spending more time being active are clear for both adults and children, and we need to be encouraging this before people accept our over-use of screens as the norm.”

			<Text type="Content">Released in May 2013 by Medibank and leading management consulting firm, The Nous Group, the compelling research paper – The Case for Mental Health Reform in Australia – provided an in-depth review of healthcare expenditure and system design. The research:
•	Provided a complete picture of the direct financial costs of supporting people with a mental illness in Australia 
•	Examined the structure of the current Australian mental health system
•	Reviewed domestic and international examples of how integrated approaches to mental healthcare and social services deliver better health outcomes and a better experience for patients, as well as improved cost effectiveness.
[b]Getting the complete picture[/b]
Medibank and Nous Group’s research looked at whole-of-system expenditure, including the activities that lie outside hospital services and community and public health services. 
The report highlighted that although both policy attention and new funding are being directed towards mental health, there is still a large number of mentally ill people who fall through the gaps and don’t receive appropriate care. It also identified fragmentation and overlap among a wide variety of bodies responsible for funding and budgets, including the Australian Government, state governments, private health insurers, the corporate sector and consumers – resulting in inefficient spending and driving up costs.
[b]Taking the lead in mental health reform[/b]
Though the report identified significant challenges facing Australia’s mental health care system, it also highlighted an unprecedented opportunity for Australia to lead the world in end-to-end mental health system redesign, delivering better outcomes at a lower cost. 
The report suggested that by adopting an integrated approach, Australia can provide the most effective care for those suffering from mental illness and set the standard for best practice mental health care across the globe.
[b]From talking the talk to walking the walk[/b]
Demonstrating commitment to the cause, in November 2013 Medibank partnered with beyondblue to host a roundtable involving more than 40 of Australia’s leading thinkers in mental health, health and social services. Based on the insights and discussions at the workshop, Medibank and beyondblue published the report, Australia’s Mental Health System – can we achieve generational change?
Medibank has since taken the outcomes of the research and roundtable event to inform a submission to the National Mental Health Commission – the government agency responsible for building a better mental health system – as part of Medibank’s mission to take the lead on policy reform in mental health.</Text>

A mental health system with:
•	Timely, affordable and equitable access to mental health services
•	Fewer unnecessary public hospital admissions
•	Better care coordination for consumers of mental health services
•	Efficient expenditure on quality mental health care
•	Services that address skills shortages and provide 24/7 care.
But major system changes are needed to get the best outcomes – from detection and diagnosis to treatment and ongoing recovery.
At Medibank we deliver a range of evidence-based programs that give Australians 24/7 access to trained mental health professionals via online, telephone and face-to-face channels, including:
•	Care coordination and counselling
•	Mental health triage 
•	Relapse prevention
•	Occupational health medicine 
•	Suicide prevention follow-up and support 
•	Return to work programs 
•	Mental health services for the justice system. 
Demonstrating our commitment to better mental health, we also partner with like-minded organisations such as beyondblue to influence mental health policy and reform, and ultimately provide better care and life outcomes for all Australians.</Text>

			<Text type="Content">With around 50% of substance abuse problems in young people developing after the onset of mental illness, and a youth suicide rate among the highest in the world, it is critical those with mental illness have somewhere to turn.
That’s why, since early 2013, Medibank has provided a 24 hour service on behalf of beyondblue that connects people with a qualified mental health professional via phone or online chat. The beyondblue Support Service helps people seeking care for themselves, along with friends, family, colleagues and employers who are impacted by mental illness.
And it’s making a big difference. Though the service is available to all Australians, the online chat has been particularly popular among younger people, giving those nervous about using traditional face-to-face avenues an easy, confidential and anonymous way to seek help and advice, often for the first time. In fact, people aged under 20 account for 40% of all interactions with online chat, with a spike in young people using the service around end-of-year-exams. 
The beyondblue Support Service is just one way Medibank is using its clinical expertise to partner with like-minded organisations to provide the care people need – when, where and how they need it.</Text>

Chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart diseases and arthritis make up a large proportion of hospital admissions in Australia. Often, it’s simply a case of people being unaware that their condition may be managed or treated through GPs or specialists.

But we know that our members value their GPs, so we want to enhance that relationship. Our Better Health programs are aimed at helping members understand the care options available so they can reduce avoid unnecessary hospital stays. At the same time, we’re committed to supporting GPs and specialists so they can provide the best possible care for their patients.

			<Text type="Content">Closing the gap
We recently conducted research into community perceptions of life expectancy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, which found that most Australians believed that ‘health’ and ‘poor living conditions’ are responsible for a gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.

As a community we know there’s a gap, and we must close it.

In 2012, we became the first private health insurer to develop a Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). In it we outlined the action we would take to improve the health and wellbeing outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health.

Since then we’ve worked hard to accomplish those actions, and we’ve already seen improvements in employee engagement and cultural awareness. But we’re constantly learning and adapting our RAP to improve its outcomes.

We revised our RAP last year to develop our understanding of the barriers and opportunity for improvement to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health care. To do this we consulted with organisations already working to improve the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. This also led to a number of organisations benefiting from $100,000 in grants from the Medibank Community Fund to assist or enhance their programs.

We’re making progress, but we can’t stop now. We know that until there is genuine equality in health and wellbeing, not only will our RAP continue, it must continue.</Text>

We want to encourage all Australians to take control of their health, so Medibank has partnered with flybuys to reward members for being active. By using a Fitbit to record their daily activity, members will be able to earn flybuys points whenever they reach a daily 10,000 step goal.

It’s our way of making the benefits of better health even better.

Fruit and Vegetables
We are what we eat, and making healthy choices when we go shopping is another simple change that will result in better health for Australians.

Medibank and flybuys have teamed up to reward members for making healthy choices by providing them with  triple flybuys points when they purchase fresh and frozen fruit and vegetables at Coles supermarkets

Since 2013, over 300,000 members have already joined the program.</Text>

			<Text type="Content">Leith is a registered nurse with more than 25 years’ experience and one of 2500 health professionals employed by Medibank to care for patients across Australia.
As part of the nation’s largest telephone triage, health advice and referral service, Leith assesses callers based on their symptoms before providing advice and recommendations on what care they need. 
Just one telehealth nurse can support 6,000 patients each year.
Like 85% of Medibank’s nurse workforce, Leith works from home as part of our work@home model, which lets her balance her important role in providing quality healthcare with her equally important role as a mum.
“I can work from home during the day, pick the kids up from school, help with homework, get dinner on the table, then do a few more hours of work in the evening,” Leith said. 
Thanks to nurses like Leith, the nurse triage, health advice and referral service gives patients access to years of experience and skills and helps relieve the burden on the public health system. Every year, the service results in 60,000 fewer emergency department visits, 5,000 fewer ambulance callouts and savings of almost $30 million in public healthcare costs. 
By working from home, Leith benefits too because she gets to enjoy more valuable time with her husband and her kids.

The AH&MRC (NSW) will use their grant to expand their Get Healthy program. The program coaches Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples on strategies to obtain and maintain healthy weight. They’ll also increase the availability of sports equipment and Yulunga, a series of traditional Aboriginal games. 

QAIHC (QLD) will focus on food and education. Their grant will fund a week-long program that encourages Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth to attend university. At the same time participants will also be equipped with life skills like cooking and living healthy lifestyles.

Winnunga Nimmityjah (ACT) and Kura Yerlo (SA) are also tackling health issues caused by poor nutritional education. With diabetes a widespread health issue for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, their programs will empower participants with the knowledge to manage their condition. They’ll also work to halt the spread of diabetes through education about healthy nutrition and exercise.

VACCHO will deliver their redesigned “Tucker Talk Tips”. It will ensure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Victoria are benefiting from improved understanding of nutrition and exercise.

Derbarl Yerrigan’s grant will allow them to expand their ‘Daisy Petals’ program, which improves the health of Aboriginal women in Western Australia. Participants will benefit from extensive assessments of their own health. They’ll also learn about specific women’s health issues, from the importance of breast and cervical screening to social and emotional wellbeing.

The AHCWA (WA) will to take to the airwaves. Their grant will deliver 12-months of radio spots that will promote healthy lifestyle choices and disease prevention across vast distances and to a huge number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

The AHCSA will get rolling to eliminate racism through their roller derby team. While those in the team will have a lot of fun, they’ll act as role models who’ll demonstrate the benefits of an active lifestyle and encourage harmony between Australian communities in South Australia.</Text>

Yalari offers students the chance to enrich their understanding of their heritage while also opening opportunities to study at some of Australia’s best schools. Yalari’s emphasis on leadership and cultural pride matches our hope that students might one day emerge from their educational journey to take up prominent roles in the health sector.

Jayde is a Yalari scholarship recipient who is currently attending Geelong Grammar School. Although it’s a long way from home in Derby, WA, she’s taken the brave step in order to improve the future for herself and her community. 

“I applied for a scholarship because I knew opportunities for my future might be limited if I stayed at home,” said Jayde. “I wanted to leave home and get a great education, so after school I can hopefully help support more family than if I’d stayed.

Jayde has leapt right into to life in Geelong, participating in the school’s renowned Outdoor Education programs in the Victorian Alps.

“I’d never seen snow until I went to Timbertop, I’d never been outside Western Australia or the Northern Territory,” she said. “Most importantly I’ve learned how to push myself, and now I know how much I’m capable of achieving.”

Jayde is now considering moving forward towards university education, an opportunity that is likely to have remained out of reach in her hometown.

The $10,600 grant will be used to establish an organic garden that will be available to the wider community, to encourage growing, cooking and eating health food, social interaction and physical exercise. The garden will provide inclusive programs, targeting vulnerable community members, with hands-on skills in sustainable gardening, waste management and food preservation. There are plans to have regular visits and demonstrators from educators to the community garden on gardening skills, open days and cooking demonstrations.</Text>

			<Text type="Content">Medibank Place signals the creation of a healthier working environment, designed with health at the forefront of every decision. Supported by Leadership and a new way of working, the result is a truly flexible and creative working environment that is designed to improve productivity, collaboration and innovation. 

Medibank employees, visitors and our Docklands neighbours will enjoy green spaces providing better air quality and natural cooling. Inside Medibank Place, the many rejuvenation and social settings will help our people recharge and connect including spiral staircases for active connection between floors. Our standing desks will reduce the amount of sitting time for our people throughout the day.  

Medibank Place encourages physical health throughout the work day with the incorporation of a gym, dedicated bike storage, a multipurpose court and change room facilities to support people to exercise… all part of delivering on our ‘For Better Health’ purpose. 

Green spaces inside-and-out provide better air quality and natural cooling, while spiral staircases create active connections between floors. And with 5 of our Melbourne offices coming together inside, it’s literally bringing our teams closer.

It’s a healthier way of working. The new building gives our team the freedom to choose where and how they work, which we know leads to happier, more productive employees, who’ll deliver better outcomes for our members. 

Medibank Place gives us a home that embodies our commitment to delivering better health and wellbeing to all Australians.</Text>
