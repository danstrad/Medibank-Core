Doc3 - Text hard to read over bus image

Orange section has all the content laddering up, instead of across the screen.

Doc5:
	Needs at least one image. E.g; someone playing golf, or climbing stairs. Prefer older person. (Using which option?)
	Could remove a quote to make this less wordy - needs image as above



Anything in ""quotes needs to be in Medibank Bree font
	Doc5, Doc7, Prof2, Prof3, Prof5, Prof6, Prof7, Prof8
	




DAN:-------------------------------------

Vision:
	Correct formatting in up front screens

Prof3:
	layout: Quote is hiding a bit too much behind photo
	
Prof9:
	layout: Quote box hides too much behind the image - you can't see the whole quote




DONT CARE:-----------------------------------

art1:
	F and G expand
