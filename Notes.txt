DESIGN:
	multitouch - pan? zoom could cause problems. Just zoom on boxes?
	
OPTIMIZATION:
	Pooling?
	Too many videos on screen at once is slowing it down. (Only show video in big home groups? Would still be displayed at scale 0 though)
	blendmode (invertex boxes) causing jitters? Use mask instead
	
stop coords blowing out?

Secondary motion on orange and blue?


cacheAsBitmap when animation finished?

Put a cap on zMoveFactor effect?

Videos still going in the background with Infographics
also BackgroundImage

Make extra storyHeaders expand instantly to avoid animation slowdown


allow overriding the dir for each box in Sprouting


DONE
----------------------------------------------------------------
Floaters come out slower and staggered
Stagger orange
Size variation in story headers
Camera more fluid - slower zoom out
Header anims - all shrink, then move, then grow  - to avoid overlaps
make the default camera position for a new story not grid aligned, so the screen doesnt cut off at the edge of a box
Scrolling off the edge pulls you back. More smooth and effortless scrolling all around. Flick screen = scroll for a while
Images scrolling within their box - based on z for purple, but also in other styles
inverse text over an image is not great
Purple animation when clicking a story header - bring forward & turn white, then grow, then shoot out articles. Move to static positions based on the type of content they're going to show
story headers grow and move
Blue story header roll out the end
camera area doesn't account for an expanded header. recalc camera on click? just buffer it out more?
Quote text is messed up when in a rectangular box
Exit anims. Fold back in, shrink, etc
If idle for a while, return to start
looping video sucks. need two streams
Alternate AnimationData for small home buttons?
gentle autoscroll panning when a new story folds out
When showing a chapter, keep the home buttons further in screen in their initial position - Not working because panArea won't allow for it. Inflate bounds of big home buttons?
Put a wait on the story headers expanding after new home buttons appear
Zoom out when scrolling?
Back button from fullscreen video
